The Core classes were successfully installed. You can now run

script/configure_talia

to set up the main configuration for database and RDF store. You can also 
create the configuration by hand.

WARNING: Talia can create HUGE log files, depending on the level. It is
highly recommended that you at least add something like this to your
environment.rb file:

config.logger = Logger.new("#{RAILS_ROOT}/log/#{RAILS_ENV}.log", 3, 104857600)

After you are set up, you can start importing data.
